## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
For this warm-up, please use the `heartrate` data. Be sure to label your plots!
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(paletteer)
library(janitor)
library(here)
```

```{r}
here()
```

```{r}
heartrate <- read.csv(here("lab11", "data", "heartrate.csv"))
```

1. Make a plot that compares the heartrate of patients for drug a.
```{r}
heartrate %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=patient, y=a, fill=patient))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(tittle="Comparison of drug A",
       x=NULL,
       y="Heartrate")
```

2. Make a plot that compares heartrate (as a range) for each drug.
```{r}
heartrate %>%
  pivot_longer(-patient,
               names_to = "drug",
               values_to = "heartrate") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=drug, y=heartrate, fill=drug))+
  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.7)
```
